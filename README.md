# Custom Linux Shell

Custom Linux Shell is a customized Linux shell (terminal) developed using C++. The program is designed to be executed through the default terminal.

## Features

The Custom Linux Shell includes the following main features:

- **Input Redirection**: Input redirection allows the user to redirect the input of a command from a file instead of the standard input. This feature enables the shell to support corresponding terminal commands that require input from a file.

- **Output Redirection**: Output redirection enables the user to redirect the output of a command to a file instead of the standard output. This feature allows the shell to support corresponding terminal commands that generate output and need to save it to a file.

- **Linux Pipes**: Linux pipes allow the execution of multiple and complex concatenated commands. Pipes enable the output of one command to be used as input for another command in a sequential manner. This feature enhances the functionality of the shell by supporting the execution of more advanced and versatile command combinations.

## Usage

To run the Custom Linux Shell, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Compile the C++ program using the provided source code.
3. Execute the compiled program to start the Custom Linux Shell.
4. Start entering commands and utilizing the available features of the shell.

## Example Commands

Here are a few example commands that can be executed in the Custom Linux Shell:

- Input Redirection: `command < input.txt`
- Output Redirection: `command > output.txt`
- Linux Pipes: `command1 | command2`
